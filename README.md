# "Quiz Whiz": Personal AI Tutor Application
[JavaDoc Website](https://thetruejm.github.io/CAB302-Exceptional-Handlers/apidocs/ai.tutor.cab302exceptionalhandlers/module-summary.html)

**Project Brief:** *Quiz Whiz* aims to assist students with learning and studying their subjects more effectively, by supporting to their individual needs, learning styles, and pace. This will be facilitated through an integrated AI tutor, which allows students to engage in conversations and discuss the content they’re learning. Furthermore, students can request quizzes to be generated by the AI, where they can then take the quiz and receive their results interactively in the application. Thus, these features allow students to instantly receive feedback on their learning, in addition to furthering their own knowledge and understanding on a variety of subjects and topics of their choosing. With this, the AI settings can be customised and personalised by students, including specifying a study area, education level, and attitude for responses, and a difficulty and length for quizzes.

**Key Features:**
- User Authentication with Secure Encrypted Password Storage
- Integrated AI Model acting as a Personal Learning and Study Tutor
- Ability to create Chats to have Independent Conversations with the AI
- The AI can Generate Quizzes based on a Prompt and the Chat’s Previous Messages
- Quizzes include different Question Types, including Multi-Choice and True or False
- Users can answer Quizzes iteratively and receive their Results
- Customisable Settings of the AI’s Responses and Generated Quizzes

**Project Requirements**:
- **Ollama Installation** with Qwen3:4B (see below for Setup Intructions)

## Ollama Setup Instructions
1. Go to the [Ollama Download](https://ollama.com/download) website
2. Install the correct Ollama Version for your Device Operating System
3. Run Ollama through the respective means of your Device Operating System
4. Open your respective Command Line Terminal
5. Run the following Terminal Command Line to install Qwen3:4b on your Device:
```bash
ollama run qwen3:4b
```

## Contributing to this Project: Git Command Information and Instructions
### Project Connection
1. Create new IntelliJ Project (JavaFx, Maven build)

2. Connect to this Git Repo:
```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/TheTrueJM/CAB302-Exceptional-Handlers.git
```

3. Download all Files:
```bash
$ git pull origin main
```

### Making Changes to this Repo
Before making any Changes, make sure you're in the right Branch:
```bash
$ git branch
* MyNameBranch 
main
```
Wherever the `*` is at, that's the current selected Branch:


If the Branch you want doesn't exist, do this:
```bash
$ git branch <branch name>
```

To select the Branch you want, do this:
```bash
$ git switch <branch name>
```

Now, before you make any Changes, make sure your Branch is up-to-date with the Main Branch:
```bash
$ git fetch origin
$ git pull origin main
```

Next, do the Changes you need, Stage them, then Commit:
```bash
# Do your changes here...

# Add the relevant files into staging
$ git add <file 1> <file 2> <file 3> <file n>
$ git add . # If you want to stage ALL changes

# If you want to unstage files
$ git restore --staged <file>

# Commit those changes
$ git status # IF you want to see what's staged and unstaged, untracked files
$ git commit -m "my new commit"

# Now push to your branch
$ git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

Finally, on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheTrueJM/CAB302-Exceptional-Handlers/pulls), make a Pull Request (**PR**) using your Branch:

**Notes:**
- You can keep working making edits after you open a PR, just keep committing and pushing your code. No need to make a new branch or anything like that
- Make sure the team gives the green flag on your changes before we merge them into then main branch
- If you stage a file then make changes, you have to stage them again with `git add`

### Handling merge conflicts
- For Team Members: Ping the team on Discord

### Reverting commits (If you haven't Pushed yet)
You can Revert your Commit by doing this:
```bash
# If you commit accidentally, or forgot to add something
$ git commit -m "my bad & broken commit"

# Simply do this
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Now, modify the changes you wanted to do originally, and then commit
$ git commit -m "my happy code"
$ git push origin <your branch>
```

## Setting up IntelliJ for Unit Tests, Compile, Running
### Unit Tests in InteliJ**
1. Run -> Edit Configurations
2. Add new configuration -> JUnit
3. In the dropdown that says `Class`, pick `All in Package` instead
4. Run the Unit Test (this will save as well)

### Compile-Only & Run using Maven**
1. Run -> Edit configurations -> Add New Configuration -> Maven
2. On the `Run` textbox type `clean compile` then click **Apply**
3. Name this configuration `Compile`
4. Repeat step 1
5. Type `clean javafx:run`
6. Name the configuration `Run`
7. Click apply

On the top right, you can now choose between Unit Test, Compile, or Run.

## Running spotless
Before committing, you can lint your java files
```
mvn spotless:apply
```

## Running Pre-Commit Hooks (Advanced)
This will automatically run spotless every time you make a new commit
```sh
# Install pre-commit via pip
pip install pre-commit

# Install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit to run spotless linter
pre-commit run --all-files
```
