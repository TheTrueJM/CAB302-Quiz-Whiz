# \[In-Progress]
# "Quiz Whiz": Personal AI Tutor
[JavaDoc Website](https://thetruejm.github.io/CAB302-Exceptional-Handlers/apidocs/ai.tutor.cab302exceptionalhandlers/module-summary.html)

**Project Brief:** The aim of this project is to develop a personal AI tutor application for students to study and understand learning material. The AI will assist in the learning of the content and materials the user discusses and provides. Quizzes can be generated by the AI so that the user can test their knowledge on studied topics and receive feedback on areas which can be improved Users will be able to customise the AI model to suit their needs, so that it’s responses are at a specific education level, or so that quizzes can be of a certain length or difficulty.

**Key Features:**
- The Application will feature an AI model which acts as a Personal Study and Learning Tutor for Users
- Users must Authenticate into the Application to access the AI functionality
- Users can maintain Multiple Conversations with the AI
- User Learning Materials and Notes can be provided to the AI through Chat Messages or with Uploaded Markdown Files
- The AI can break up Learning Content into modules consisting of separate topics with study recommendations
- The AI will be able to generate Quizzes for Users based on their Learning Materials and Previous Chat Messages
- Quizzes can be of different types, such as Multi-Choice, True or False Flash Card, and Short Response
- Users can receive Feedback on their Quiz Answers in the form of Correct or Incorrect Marks, and Explanations
- Following a Quiz, the AI can suggest Study “Focus Areas” based on the User's Performance (Questions and Topics they had trouble with)
- The AI’s settings are Customisable, allowing Users to adjust the AI’s Response Education Level (primary school, high school, university), or the Difficulty of Quiz Questions

## Git Command Information and Instructions
### Project Connection
Create new IntelliJ Project (JavaFx, Maven build)

Connect to this Git Repo
```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/TheTrueJM/CAB302-Exceptional-Handlers.git
```

Download all Files
```bash
$ git pull origin main
```

### Making Changes to this Repo
Before making any changes, make sure you're in the right branch
```bash
$ git branch
* MyNameBranch 
main
```
Wherever the `*` is at, that's the current selected branch


If the branch you want doesn't exist, do this
```bash
$ git branch <branch name>
```

To select the branch you want, do this
```bash
$ git switch <branch name>
```

Now, before you make any changes, MAKE SURE YOUR BRANCH IS UP TO DATE TO THE MAIN BRANCH
```bash
$ git fetch origin
$ git pull origin main
```

Next, do the changes you need, stage them, then commit:
```bash
# Do your changes here...

# Add the relevant files into staging
$ git add <file 1> <file 2> <file 3> <file n>
$ git add . # If you want to stage ALL changes

# If you want to unstage files
$ git restore --staged <file>

# Commit those changes
$ git status # IF you want to see what's staged and unstaged, untracked files
$ git commit -m "my new commit"

# Now push to your branch
$ git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

Finally, on github, make a Pull Request (**PR**) using your branch: https://github.com/TheTrueJM/CAB302-Exceptional-Handlers/pulls

**Notes:**
- You can keep working making edits after you open a PR, just keep committing and pushing your code. No need to make a new branch or anything like that
- Make sure the team gives the green flag on your changes before we merge them into then main branch
- If you stage a file then make changes, you have to stage them again with `git add`

### Handling merge conflicts
Ping us on discord

### Reverting commits (If you haven't pushed yet)
You can revert your commit by doing this
```bash
# If you commit accidentally, or forgot to add something
$ git commit -m "my bad & broken commit"

# Simply do this
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Now, modify the changes you wanted to do originally, and then commit
$ git commit -m "my happy code"
$ git push origin <your branch>
```

## Setting up intelij for unit tests, compile, running
### Unit tests in intelij**
1. Run -> Edit Configurations
2. Add new configuration -> JUnit
3. In the dropdown that says `Class`, pick `All in Package` instead
4. Run the unit test (this will save as well)

### Compile-only & Run using Maven**
1. Run -> Edit configurations -> Add New Configuration -> Maven
2. On the `Run` textbox type `clean compile` then click **Apply**
3. Name this configuration `Compile`
4. Repeat step 1
5. Type `clean javafx:run`
6. Name the configuration `Run`
7. Click apply

On the top right, you can now choose between unit test, compile, or run

## Running spotless
Before committing, you can lint your java files
```
mvn spotless:apply
```

## Running pre-commit hooks (Advanced)
This will automatically run spotless every time you make a new commit
```sh
# Install pre-commit via pip
pip install pre-commit

# Install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit to run spotless linter
pre-commit run --all-files
```
